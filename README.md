# To-Do-List-Web-Application_Task-2-

This project is a simple To-Do List web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The core task was to create a functional interface where users can enter tasks into a text box and add them to a list using an Add button. Each task must appear one below the other and include two essential controls: an Edit button to modify the task and a Delete button to remove it. Additionally, the Edit button should allow the user to update the text and save the changes.

Beyond meeting all required features, the project has been enhanced with several improvements to create a smoother user experience. These enhancements include local storage support to store tasks even after refreshing the page, a modern UI layout with centered elements, clean animations, and polished button styling that elevates the overall interface. These additional features go beyond the mandatory requirements while still preserving the original purpose and simplicity of the task.
